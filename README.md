# Awesome Godot Scientific / Computation
A curated list of [free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) add-ons and scripts for Godot, but specifically for hyperoptimized computation and scientific methodology.

You can find a general list for free Godot stuff in Godot's own [Awesome Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/awesome-godot).

### What is scientific software?

For the sake of this repository, scientific software is software that is commonly used by scientists to achieve their goals. You may have heard of software such as [NumPy](https://numpy.org), [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org) and [MatLab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html). These are the kinds of things we are talking about.

### What is hyperoptimized computation?

General-purpose programming is very useful. But when you have large amounts of data, your program can start to slow down a lot. This is because general purpose programming can waste a lot of CPU cycles for duplicated or unnecessary logic.

To solve this issue, many smart people have optimized common operations, such as addition, matrix multiplications, or even convolutions. This comes in many forms, but often involves hyperoptimized CPU or GPU instructions such as [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_data) or [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone#:~:text=CUDAÂ®%20is%20a%20parallel,harnessing%20the%20power%20of%20GPUs.). If you want your code to be fast, you can use these implementations to speed it up.

### Use-Case Decider

Here you can find a table of recommendations by use-case. This is not hard data, but rather a subjective interpretation made by us. Ultimately, you'll have to decide for yourself. The use-cases are the most popular from our survey: https://forms.gle/PVyRcQZpifjMxdKB8
