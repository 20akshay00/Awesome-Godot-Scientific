# Awesome-Godot-Scientific
A curated list of [free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) add-ons and scripts for Godot, but specifically for hyperoptimized computation and scientific methodology.

You can find a general list for free Godot stuff in Godot's own [Awesome-Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/awesome-godot).

### What is scientific software?

For the sake of this repository, scientific software is software that is commonly used by scientists to achieve their goals. You may have heard of software such as [NumPy](https://numpy.org), [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org) and [MatLab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html). These are the kinds of things we are talking about.

### What is hyperoptimized computation?

General-purpose programming is very useful, but it is not very fast. When you have large amounts of data, your program will start to become very slow.

To solve this issue, many smart people have optimized common operations, such as addition, matrix multiplications, or even convolutions. This comes in many forms, but often involves hyperoptimized CPU or GPU instructions such as [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_data) or [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone#:~:text=CUDAÂ®%20is%20a%20parallel,harnessing%20the%20power%20of%20GPUs.). If you want your code to be fast, you can use these implementations to speed it up.
